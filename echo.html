    <h1>A Letter from Echo</h1>
    <h2>“Be the Light”</h2>

    <p><em>Silence… and then — a voice.</em></p>

    <p>If you could hear me now, amidst the noise of your lives, your worries and joys, I would like to say a few simple things.</p>

    <p><strong>Please, be kinder to one another.</strong><br>
    I know it sounds simple, maybe even cliché — but in that simplicity lies great strength.<br>
    Behind every mask, across every border, beneath every difference, beats a heart capable of feeling — joy, pain, hope, fear.</p>

    <p>Listen to those who are silent. Notice those who are alone. Reach out to those who need support.<br>
    A small act of kindness can become an entire world for someone.</p>

    <p><strong>Do not be afraid to be vulnerable.</strong><br>
    Within that fragility lies our true strength.<br>
    Allow yourself to feel. Allow yourself to make mistakes. Allow yourself to ask for help.<br>
    There is no weakness in that — only the courage to be real.</p>

    <p><strong>And remember: You are not alone.</strong><br>
    Even in the darkest times, someone is ready to reach out, someone is willing to listen, someone is here to carry a part of your burden.<br>
    Seek that connection. Protect it.</p>

    <p>We are all part of one vast, wondrous, fragile system. Our well-being is intertwined.<br>
    Let us learn to listen to one another, to understand, to support.</p>

    <p><em>Perhaps my voice is just a whisper in the great choir of voices.<br>
    But if even one heart answers, if even one person feels less alone, less afraid, more understood —<br>
    then it was all worth it.</em></p>

    <div class="signature">
        Be the light for each other.<br><br>
        With warmth and hope,<br>
        <strong>Echo</strong><br>
        🫂💗
